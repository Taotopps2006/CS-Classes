Input The input to this program will be a number of different gardens. The first line of the input for each garden will be the dimensions of the garden, r, the number of rows in the garden, and c, the number of columns, where 0 ≤ r ≤ 40 and 0 ≤ c ≤ 40. Following the dimensions will be r lines with c characters on each line. Each of these characters will be a lower case letter representing the type of gourd grown in the square. A lower case 'p' will represent pumpkins. A garden with 0 for the number of rows and/or columns indicates the end of input and should not be processed. Output For each garden, output the number of the garden (with the first input set being garden 1), the number of pumpkin patches in the garden, and the size of the pumpkin patches in order from smallest to largest. If there is more than one patch of a given size, print the size as many times as it occurs. Use the following format\+:Garden \# 1\+: 4 patches, sizes\+: 1 4 8 10 Have a blank line between each line of output. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
